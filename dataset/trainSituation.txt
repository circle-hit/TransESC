If that person's partner isn't willing to try harder to fulfill that need, it's probably time to move on, she says Tell your BF or GF that you want to talk about something important. Start by mentioning something you like or value about the other person. ... Say what's not working (your reason for the break-up). ... Say you want to break up

We both make about the same income.
My girl decided to break up with me by text, instead of in person. It was a breakup that other friends also heard about and asked me about not much later in the breakup process.
I asked my friend if she would go to the store with me because I was feeling down and overwhelmed with kids. She said she was too tired so she would have to pass this time. I was angry because I always support her when she is down or needs it. When I need it, she is nowhere to be seen. It's okay I guess for her to be depressed, but no one else can, because she has already monopolized that emotion. How can you ask someone for help when you are feeling depressed when they are depressed themselves?

Every few nights at nighttime, I get severely depressed and I don't know why
I've been struggling to motivate myself generally, and no longer feel pleasure in the things I do on a daily basis.
I love my friends. But sometimes I feel as if I can't really be myself around them without being judged for doing something. I've known them for quite a long time now. I don't know if i am just being sensitive or what, but I feel like I'm the one that gets bullied in the friend group.

I have nobody in my life that supports me. No purpose to my life. My husband treats me like dirt. I am just so frustrated with being sad all the time but just when I think it is looking up, I get knocked down again.
i caught my boyfriend cheating with a friend
I can't get a haircut due to pandemic, my hair is a disaster. I'm getting older and things are sagging. I am too shy to go on camera for my zoom meetings. And afraid to be rejeected once i am ready to date again.
I don't have any friends. People keep betraying me when I think I can be close to them.
my close friend became an avid antivaxxer and felt it was his job to pressure me over it...he wouldn't drop it and so i had to cut off communication, at least for now.
Not able to find suitable job
I recently broke up with my boyfriend and I'm having a hard time because it's almost the holidays.
My girlfriend broke up with me recently. Really not feeling it right now, especially since I could've dedicated more time to her after exams but she got fed up. I guess I'm just alone for Christmas.

I am dealing with a COVID-19 quarantining situation. Can't interact with family and friends. Wife is super paranoid about the virus.
My friends are always leaving me out of activities.
I will lose my job in January
Ive been trying to get with some of friends to hang out maybe just for a couple hours just to catch up. But no-one seems like they want to be bothered due to covid. But the other day I called this particularly person and she said that they were all out having lunch, So why wasn't I included?
A new supervisor is more controlling, doesn't trust me and is changing my work role and threatening my job. He's reducing my travel and opportunity to take additional hours and changing the direction of my current work projects. He's also from the Military and has an abrasive way of communicating with makes having conversations with him very difficult.

I'm so scared my job will fire me when they find out about my alcohol abuse
I am having trouble getting over the loss of a friendship that was important to me. I was very close to someone who acted as though he was my best friend but secretly didn't care for me at all. Eventually he told me so, and every time I think about it it feels like a punch in the stomach, even years later.
COVID, job pressure, stress with partner, sharing custody of my son, recuperating from cancer treatment
I asked my friend if she would go to the store with me because I was feeling down and overwhelmed with kids. She said she was too tired so she would have to pass this time. I was angry because I always support her when she is down or needs it. When I need it, she is nowhere to be seen. It's okay I guess for her to be depressed, but no one else can, because she has already monopolized that emotion. How can you ask someone for help when you are feeling depressed when they are depressed themselves?

As time went on, I did not know what went wrong but he started showing disinterest in matters that concerns me . When it started we had the conversation. I was worried and he assured me nothing was wrong. I later found out with a great dismay that he was going out with one of our high school acquaintances . It really hurt the more when he told me what I thought we had was over. it shattered me emotional. He went from avoiding my calls to not wanting to see me around. it hurts me badly.

I have trouble getting to sleep on time. Also when I wake up in the middle of the night I can't fall back asleep.
I asked my friend if she would go to the store with me because I was feeling down and overwhelmed with kids. She said she was too tired so she would have to pass this time. I was angry because I always support her when she is down or needs it. When I need it, she is nowhere to be seen. It's okay I guess for her to be depressed, but no one else can, because she has already monopolized that emotion. How can you ask someone for help when you are feeling depressed when they are depressed themselves?

The person ghosted me after we had an argument and I am really upset about it.
When one partner feels that the other isn't fulfilling a requirement, Wadley says, it's important to communicate that. If that person's partner isn't willing to try harder to fulfill that need, it's probably time to move on, she says Tell your BF or GF that you want to talk about something important. Start by mentioning something you like or value about the other person. ... Say what's not working (your reason for the break-up). ... Say you want to break up
I am always in the mood of depression. I thought every thing going to be happen to me in wrong way

She felt like I haven' t been there for her because I didn't pick up her call. I honestly didn't see her call and definitely would've got back to her, if I saw her call. She said mean and nasty things about me, which I don' t care about. But she did the wrong mistake of bringing my child into the equation, when he had nothing to do with it. I wanted to really beat the crap out of her because not only did she do that, she blocked my number and ran. Like I was beyond pissed.

I found out that my boyfriend had been lying to me about his entire life, and so the future that he had said we were building towards was all but impossible. I'm trying to figure out if I should stay with him.
I have a great friend that has died of corona virus. I am shattered because I could not see her in her last moments or go to her funeral. All we had was facetime. She was only 35 with severe asthma. I am reeling. This happened two weeks ago and my sadness and depression is overwhelming. How can I get over this?
Have been stuck at home due to illness and am growing tired of it.
Feelings of sadness, disappointment, or hopelessness can be a healthy reaction to lifeâ€™s challenges. Normally, these feelings come in waves, are tied to thoughts or reminders of challenging situations, only last for a short period of time, and donâ€™t interfere with school, work, or relationships.

It's okay I guess for her to be depressed, but no one else can, because she has already monopolized that emotion.

I tested positive for Covid.
I realize my career won't pay much and I feel bad for choosing it
I feel that I will fail a class this semester and I just took my last exam last week.
My boy friend left me for nothing, I tried to ask for explanation but i won't get any thing , make me depressed and felt alone.
I have trouble getting to sleep on time. Also when I wake up in the middle of the night I can't fall back asleep.
My boyfriend and I went on separate vacations with our friends, and he cheated on me while he was away.
company is closing soon. I am super stressed out about what I am going to do.
My partner just walked out on me saying he cannot do this anymore
Recently left a job due to COVID-19 virus concerns. Everyone there was amazing but I was concerned about virus risk.
Cheated on my girlfriend and she's found out and gone of with another man. I'm absolutely distraught.

COVID-19 made me lose my beautiful job which I admire a lot and I am searching for another one which is not fort coming. Please what can I do now?
My (ex)fiancÃ© and I recently broke up, but we're still spending a great deal of time together, and we both say we're not sure if our relationship is 100% "done" and agreed to tell each other if we start dating other people. He said he doesn't want to see anyone else, but I came over one night to find him with a woman. It was their third date.
Everyone breaks up with me. They all think I'm weird, and I always screw myself.
I asked my friend if she would go to the store with me because I was feeling down and overwhelmed with kids. She said she was too tired so she would have to pass this time. I was angry because I always support her when she is down or needs it. When I need it, she is nowhere to be seen. It's okay I guess for her to be depressed, but no one else can, because she has already monopolized that emotion. How can you ask someone for help when you are feeling depressed when they are depressed themselves?
my close friend became an avid antivaxxer and felt it was his job to pressure me over it...he wouldn't drop it and so i had to cut off communication, at least for now.
I have this overwhelming fear and pressure that my mother will not be accepting of my grades in school. This pressure has caused me to feel anxiety everyday and perfect all homework assignments which I do not have time for.
I was currently offered a job promotion to become a supervisor. I've been with the company for over 3 years. My supervisor was only requested for me to bring in my 12th grade transcripts, and that's something I'm not able to get my hands on. So with that being said I will have to stay an agent,
I am having real trouble sleeping and it's bring me down so much.
I'm mad at my boyfriend for not taking responsibility.
Every day is a struggle, I wake up feeling hopeless, and I am having really bad anxiety attacks that I can't calm down from.
I suffered bullying at school. for the simple fact of being not very fat but if stuffed, they called me a cow, they made the expression of a cow, they threw my bag in the trash, I had no friends. It was hard and strong to be able to study there, after that they changed my school, everything was fine until those from the previous school found out where I was studying and the bullying started again. It has had an impact on my life, I believe that even my feelings are the same, I have not been able to forget it.
I am in a deep depression, have no friends or family to talk to. I also started drinking
I recently had a baby and iam facing postpartum depression
I am very scared about next college semester it is frightening
I can't seem to find a job that I find satisfying and feel like working for a big company just isn't for me but it's all I know.
I am an anxiety person, when I have test, I'm going to travel, I'm going out and so on I will always have anxiety however I don't think it's goo to have so much anxiety, it's not good for yourself.
Going to the store gives me Panic Attacks, driving does as well.
My neighbors are all mad at me, because I was the cause of a mutual friend being evicted from our complex. Her dog attacked my dog and another dog within a week. I reported the incident to apartment management and Animal Control. She was told to get rid of her dog or move. She elected to move, but continued to say that she "got kicked out because of me". I guess friends liked her more, because now I'm the "bad guy".
The person who I thought was my best friend and who is God mother to my child, stabbed me in the back. She knew that I was in an emotionally abuse relationship yet she disclosed information to my partner that could have cost me my life or put my life at risk.
My new supervisor hates me. She already hated me before she was my boss. In addition to being a terrible manager, she has made a personal goal to inhibit my ability to do my job. She has taken from me all parts of my job that I value. This upsets me personally and I am sad & angry that the rest of my team, who I care about, is no longer supported. We have no recourse to solve this problem.
Everything was going crazy in the world with COVID. I was worried about my daughter and her education. Then suddenly, I lose a lot of my hours at work and have to quit one of my jobs due to the virus and becoming her main caretaker again. This really makes me nervous because the price of everything is continually going up and I have little excess money to spend.
Near failing a class that will pretty much depend my future career
The pandemic has made me depressed. My life feels out of control.
I am in the process of applying to colleges and my parents are making a big deal of getting into the school of their choice. If I do not, it is up to me to find a way to pay for college.
My close friend died because of Covid-19 last month, it bothers me a lot and i constantly feel depression.
I have a final in my class tomorrow, and if I don't get at least a B on the exam I might not pass the class.
girlfriend broke my heart

covid 19 issues
I have been in a depression since my father died last year. We have had to sell our home and move to a much smaller place due to losing his income. I am older but lived with my parents to help them because they are both ill. it has been an ongoing struggle
It started during my childhood, when I was 9 years old, living my father. He had a bad temper and was impatient with me, especially with school. He would raise his voice at me and get physical when I didn't do well in classes. After the age of 10, I ended up living with my mother but I would spend most of my time with my friends because I enjoyed their company more than anything. I started to hate dealing with school because I felt I wouldn't be able to do well in school; I started to get anxiety from dealing with tests and it gotten bad to the point where I couldn't really stay in crowded place as well. Today, I still try my best to tolerate going to college and do my best in classes even when my anxiety comes back.
Not being able to see family and friends due to Covid.
The person who I thought was my best friend and who is God mother to my child, stabbed me in the back. She knew that I was in an emotionally abuse relationship yet she disclosed information to my partner that could have cost me my life or put my life at risk.
When one partner feels that the other isn't fulfilling a requirement, Wadley says, it's important to communicate that. If that person's partner isn't willing to try harder to fulfill that need, it's probably time to move on, she says Tell your BF or GF that you want to talk about something important. Start by mentioning something you like or value about the other person. ... Say what's not working (your reason for the break-up). ... Say you want to break up

Start by mentioning something you like or value about the other person. ... Say what's not working (your reason for the break-up). ... Say you want to break up

I am feeling quite nervous, apprehensive and worried about the current pandemic. I fear that I, or my loved ones, can catch it and become very ill. Also, I feel a bit isolated, which has caused me to have a bit more negative feelings of sadness.
Had an issue with my wife concerning my drinking habits where she complained that I had of late been drinking soo much. There was a confrontation that almost led to a breakup and now we are not talking. The situation is serious
I have a friend who knew me since I was little, she is closer to my mother's age so she is kinda like my aunt growing up. She always treat me like I was little. I understand that she knew me since I was little. But I'm a grown woman now and I want our relationship to go far and grow more. I tried to explain it to her but she is not getting it. It's made me feel sad that we can't move our relationship further.
Ever since the insurgent of Covid-19 ,I was hit hard when I was relieved from my full-time job for a non justifiable reason. I blame it to Covid because business was slow and it affected production. I was so frustrated and I didn't know what next to do as I had past due bills and family to take care of. I started applying for government benefits none was fast coming forth and requires a lot of processing time. I later got a part-time job that the pay was low and i could not put up with the bills .it was really tough. I almost went into depression but I did not give up home. Recently I got a full-time job but I have been scared and anxious because they keep laying off employees weekly. I wouldn't want to go through the terrible situation I had last time.
I am so mad that my boyfriend broke up with me because I cheated on him once. He has cheated on me many times and I never broke up with him.
Stress from a toxic friendship, lack of support and isolation.
I was in a relationship with someone that took 5 years. We were planning on building a home together and he liked the idea and promised we would pull through together. I loved him so much that I would literary do nothing to heart his feeling. We built friendship for years and we had something beautiful and close to perfection. As time went on, I did not know what went wrong but he started showing disinterest in matters that concerns me . When it started we had the conversation. I was worried and he assured me nothing was wrong. I later found out with a great dismay that he was going out with one of our high school acquaintances . It really hurt the more when he told me what I thought we had was over. it shattered me emotional. He went from avoiding my calls to not wanting to see me around. it hurts me badly. As I recall this am feeling emotional because tit was a terrible period for me.
the pandemic
I have struggled with depression for a while but recently it seems to be getting worse, with no clear reason.
I am having trouble getting over the loss of a friendship that was important to me. I was very close to someone who acted as though he was my best friend but secretly didn't care for me at all. Eventually he told me so, and every time I think about it it feels like a punch in the stomach, even years later.
I lost my job, my car was just repossessed and my bills are all behind.
I can't sleep at night, struggling to fall or stay asleep.
I have dealt with depression around this time of the year since i was 17. I am now 37. My cousin got killed in a car accident on Dec 29th at the age of 14. Then 18 years later on Jan 3rd I lost my boyfriend in a car accident. I struggle around the holidays even worse now than I did before.
I have been laid out for not performing. But the acutal situation is the customer was satisfied my service. But the expectation of the management was not to do that.
My friends will not even call me half the time even though I am always calling them and trying to get together.

I had been terminated from a job that was in my field. I had to move back in with my parents.
Anxiety about losing my job
I am divorced and my kids live most of time with my ex wife in another state. I do not know what to do when I am in the depressed mood I feel so down in the dumps thinking of my kids. My ex wife tells them lies about me saying I left them. I came to Tennessee when I found out my mom had cancer and I got out of the military.
I have this overwhelming fear and pressure that my mother will not be accepting of my grades in school. This pressure has caused me to feel anxiety everyday and perfect all homework assignments which I do not have time for.
